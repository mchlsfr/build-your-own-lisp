› What does the preprocessor command #ifndef do?
  The c precompiler modifies a source code file before handing it over to the compiler.

  By using the #ifndef (if not defined) directive, you can include a block of text only if a particular expression is undefined;
  then, within the header file, you can define the expression.

  This ensures that the code in the #ifndef is included only the first time the file is loaded.
  Syntax:
  #ifndef <token>
  /* code */
  #else
  /* code to include if the token is defined */
  #endif

  Examples:
  #ifndef _INCL_GUARD
  #define _INCL_GUARD
  #endif

  #ifndef NULL
  #define NULL (void *)0
  #endif // #ifndef NULL

› What does the preprocessor command #define do?
  Directive #define, allows is to write macros to be referenced by our precompiler

› If _WIN32 is defined on windows, what is defined for Linux or Mac?
  __linux, __APPLE__
