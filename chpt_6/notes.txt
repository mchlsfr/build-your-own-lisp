POLISH NOTATION
Operator comes before the operands.
For example:
  (10 * 2) / (4 + 2)	is	/ (* 10 2) (+ 4 2)

Textually:
  A program is an operator followed by one or more expressions,"
  where "an expression is either a number, or, in parenthesis, an operator followed by one or more expressions"

More formally:
  Program:    The start of an input, an Operator, one or more Expression, and the end of an input
  Expression: Either a Number or '(', an Operator, one or more Expression, and an ')'
  Operator:   '+', '-', '*', or '/'
  Number:     An optional '-', and one or more characters between 0 and 9.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
Number and Program will require regex to parse correctly.

.	        Any character is required.
a	        The character a is required.
[abcdef]	Any character in the set abcdef is required.
[a-f]	    Any character in the range a to f is required.
a?	      The character a is optional.
a*	      Zero or more of the character a are required.
a+	      One or more of the character a are required.
^	        The start of input is required.
$	        The end of input is required.

So our Number rule would be: /-?[0-9]+/

INCLUDING FILES IN C
There are actually two ways to include files in C.
One is using angular brackets <> as we've seen so far, and the other is with quotation marks "".

Using angular brackets searches the system locations for headers first, 
while quotation marks searches the current directory first.
