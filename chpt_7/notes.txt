TREES

The internal structure that we saw printed by the program is an abstract syntax tree.
Example:
  "+ 1 1" yields below;
  regex
  operator|char:1:1 '+'
  expr|number|regex:1:3 '1'
  expr|number|regex:1:5 '1'
  regex

We can have a look at the definition of mpc_ast_t,
which is the data structure we got from the parse.

  typedef struct mpc_ast_t {
    char* tag;
    char* contents;
    mpc_state_t state;
    int children_num;
    struct mpc_ast_t** children;
  } mpc_ast_t;
